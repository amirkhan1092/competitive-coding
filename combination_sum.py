'''
Given an array of integers A and a sum B, find all unique combinations in A where the sum is equal to B.

ach number in A may only be used once in the combination.

Note:
   All numbers will be positive integers.
   Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
   The combinations themselves must be sorted in ascending order.
   If there is no combination possible the print "Empty" (without qoutes).
Example,
Given A = 10,1,2,7,6,1,5 and B(sum) 8,

A solution set is:

[1, 7]
[1, 2, 5]
[2, 6]
[1, 1, 6]

Input:
First is T , no of test cases. 1<=T<=500
Every test case has three lines.
First line is N, size of array. 1<=N<=12
Second line contains N space seperated integers(x). 1<=x<=9.
Third line is the sum B. 1<=B<=30.

Output:
One line per test case, every subset enclosed in () and in every set intergers should be space seperated.(See example)

Example:
Input:
2
7
10 1 2 7 6 1 5
8
5
8 1 8 6 8
12

Output:
(1 1 6)(1 2 5)(1 7)(2 6)
